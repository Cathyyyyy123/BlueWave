# BlueWave
The rhythmic dance of the "Blue-Theme Wave Pattern" shows a serene yet dynamic digital seascape. This piece is a combination of mathematical precision and artistic fluidity, where geometric shapes on a virtual canvas come to life through a choreographed wave motion.\
Each shape—a circle, rectangle, ellipse, or triangle—represents an individual drop in the vast ocean. The choice of varying colors of blue means the shallow and deep water. The blues are deep and resonant, yet playful. In addition, the different speeds of water reflect the diverse temperaments of the sea from tranquil to tempestuous.\
Moreover, the animation unfolds in a grid-like structure. Within each cell of this grid, there's a shape, which is a heartbeat, a pulse that sends those shapes into harmonious undulations. This pattern of movement is inspired by the sine waves of sound—how a simple fluctuation in air pressure can create something as profound as music. Here, the visual waves echo this auditory phenomenon, turning the animation into a silent symphony, which imitates the true sea wave.\
My creative process was both technical and visual beauty. Through the programming, I sought to capture the essence of movement and change. This work is an exploration of the boundaries between science and art, chaos and order. "Blue-Theme Wave Pattern" is an invitation to pause, to watch the waves roll by, and to find a moment of peace in the ceaseless motion of life.
